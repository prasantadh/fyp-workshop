# Basic FrontEnd Design and Implementation

This folder implements a very basic frontend based on the fundamental
technology of the browser: html, css and javascript. To make life
a little easier, we use tailwindcss for css code and jquery for js code.

The setup instructions for tailwindcss can be found on [their website](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation)
(yes, we recommend installing it using npm) and setup instructions for
jquery can be found on [w3cschools](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_get_started.asp)

## The Design

The design can be found on figma.
